Howdy! I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Boston University, co-advised by [Debarghya Mukherjee](https://debarghya-mukherjee.github.io/) and [Luis Carvalho](https://math.bu.edu/people/lecarval/); I build theoretically grounded transfer-learning methods (optimal transport, graph mining, nonparametric stats, and RL) for structured, heterogeneous data in low-sample, high-dimensional, non-IID settings.

The question that keeps me up (in a good way):

> **How can we reuse past knowledge when the world—and the data—won’t sit still?**

In statistical learning, this is about transferring geometry or smoothness from a well-understood **source** distribution to a smaller, noisier **target** under shift.  In reinforcement learning, the **source** might be prior trajectories, simulators, or related tasks, while the **target** is the evolving environment—so we need principled rules for **what to keep, what to adapt, and what to forget**. And yes—**LLMs/VLMs** make this even more exciting (and tricky): they already contain a lot of cross-domain knowledge, but the real challenge is **extracting and specializing it safely** for downstream tasks without **overfitting, hallucination, or misalignment**.

## What I build

- **Theory that actually supports practice**  
  Minimax rates, oracle inequalities, regret bounds, and safe-transfer criteria under covariate or structural shift.

- **Graph-structured transfer methods**  
  Aligning and transporting information across graphs/manifolds to make transfer robust when correspondence is messy or unknown.

- **RL/bandits under drift**  
  Warm-started policies with uncertainty-aware adaptation for reliable sequential decision-making in changing environments.

- **Transfer principles for LLMs/VLMs**  
  Controlled adaptation, domain grounding, and structure-preserving fine-tuning—so models adapt *without* getting sloppy.

If any of this resonates—whether you’re thinking about theory, systems, or real-world deployment—I’d love to connect.

*Boston University*

- **Graphon transfer without node correspondence:** aligns source/target graphs via **Gromov–Wasserstein**, then transfers edge-probability structure in a fully nonparametric way.  
- **Provably stable + practically strong:** **residual smoothing** boosts small/sparse/heterogeneous targets, with **convergence & stability guarantees** and SOTA gains on link prediction / graph classification.

[**SCOT: Multi-Source Cross-City Transfer with Optimal-Transport
Soft-Correspondence Objectives**](#)<br>
*Boston University; Shandong University*

- **Explicit many-to-many correspondence (no node matching):** learns a **Sinkhorn entropic-OT coupling** between unequal region sets and uses it to define **soft aligned pairs** for cross-city transfer.  
- **OT-guided semantic sharpening + stability:** combines **OT-weighted contrastive alignment** with **cycle-style reconstruction**; extends to multi-source with a **target-aware prototype hub** to prevent collapse and handle strong heterogeneity.

[**From Text to Forecasts: Bridging Modality Gap with Temporal Evolution Semantic Space**](#)<br>
*Boston University; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; Shandong University*

- **Bridges the text–time-series modality gap:** introduces a **Temporal Evolution Semantic Space (TESS)** that distills free-form text into **interpretable temporal primitives** (mean shift, volatility, shape, lag), instead of directly fusing noisy token embeddings.  
- **LLM-guided yet numerically grounded forecasting:** uses **structured prompting + confidence-aware gating** to inject reliable semantic signals as prefix tokens into a Transformer forecaster, yielding **robust gains under event-driven non-stationarity** (up to **29% error reduction**).

*Boston University; Chicago Booth*

- **New minimax theory for “near-manifold” shift:** exposes a sharp **phase transition** controlled by the **support gap** between target and source neighborhoods—unifying multiple geometric-transfer regimes.  
- **Ratio-free, adaptive estimator:** achieves **near-optimal, dimension-adaptive rates** **without density ratios** and without assuming knowing the geometry (works under approximate manifold mismatch).
